## Visualising Earthquake Data with Leaflet

## Requirements
The summary requirements for this homework are as follows: -
“ Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualise their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualise their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organisations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet. 

Your first task is to visualise an earthquake data set ……from the USGS GeoJSON Feed page. 

The USGS wants you to plot a second data set on your map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. You will need to pull in a second data set and visualise it alongside your original set of data. Data on tectonic plates can be found at https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates. “ 

The full details of the requirements for this homework can be found in the directories / files detailed below. 

## The “leaflet-challenge/starting-code-files/instructions” directory contains the directories / files submitted for assessment:
* “README” and “Leaflet_Grading_Rubric” files containing the detailed instructions and grading assessment for the assignment,
* “Images” directory containing the provided images of the required outputs for the assignment and the header image courtesy of UCLA,
* “index-provided.html”: the HTML file that was provided as part of the starting code for the assignment,
* “screenshots” directory containing screenshots of the outputs produced for the visualisations,
* “index.html”: the HTML file that drives the “US Geological Survey: Earthquakes Data Visualisations for the Last 7 Days”,
* “static/js” directory that contains the “config.sys” file and the “logic.js” for the application invoked by the HTML,
 	(NOTE: The “config.sys” file uses the default public key produced by Mapbox.)
* “static/css” directory that contains the “style” CSS file used by the HTML,
* “README-wip is a work in process README file produced with the Writage Word extension and used as the basis for the README file for the github repository.

## Tackling the Assignment
### The assignment was tackled by combining the two USGS requirements and designing a solution to: -
* visualise an earthquake data set,
* to include popups providing information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked,
* to include a number of base maps to choose from,
* to separate two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently,
* to add layer controls to the map. 

### Screenshots of the various outputs follow.
